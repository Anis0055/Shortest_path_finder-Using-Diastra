Shortest Path in Undirected Graph
Project Overview
This project provides an implementation for finding the shortest path in an undirected graph using graph traversal algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS), depending on whether the graph is weighted or unweighted.

Features:
Handles both weighted and unweighted graphs.
Efficient pathfinding with optimal time complexity using appropriate algorithms.
Support for custom graph input.
Returns the shortest path between two nodes, if one exists.

Algorithms Used
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Used for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. It guarantees the shortest path if all edge weights are non-negative.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Used for unweighted graphs, where every edge has an implicit weight of 1.
